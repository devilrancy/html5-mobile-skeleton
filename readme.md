HTML5 Mobile Skeleton
---------------------------------------

A skeleton for mobile HTML5 apps. Ready-to-go webroot directory, intended to get things started fast.

This repository features a basic HTML-only skeleton as well as a simple [SLIM PHP](https://github.com/codeguy/Slim) app with [Twig](https://github.com/fabpot/Twig) templates. To install all dependencies, [get Composer](https://getcomposer.org/) and run
```bash
curl -sS https://getcomposer.org/installer | php
php composer.phar install
```

This app skeleton comes with some simple [Grunt](http://gruntjs.com/) tasks (concat and uglify JavaScript files, watch and compile SCSS files, compile LESS) to make your life even easier. If you want to use those you can get the required node modules by running
```bash
npm install
```
