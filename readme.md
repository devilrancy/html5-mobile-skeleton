HTML5 Mobile Skeleton
---------------------------------------

A skeleton for mobile HTML5 apps. Ready-to-go webroot directory, intended to get things started -- on a prettty basic level. A lot of this is inspired by (and in fact uses a fair amount of) the awesome HTML5 Boilerplate.

##GIT Submodules
A couple of external vendor repos are git-submoduled into this repo for extra convenience. Thanks for the fish.

Those are the extra repos:
* h5bp mobile boilerplate<br/>
  [on github](https://github.com/h5bp/html5-boilerplate)
* hammer.js<br/>
  [on github](https://github.com/EightMedia/hammer.js)
  
Run update-vendors.sh/.bat to pull updates from the vendor repos.

##Dependencies
This skeleton expects you to have SASS and CoffeeScript avaialble on your machine.
