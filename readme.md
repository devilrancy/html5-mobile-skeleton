HTML5 Mobile Skeleton
---------------------------------------

A skeleton for mobile HTML5 apps. Ready-to-go webroot directory, intended to get things started &mdash; on a pretty basic level. A lot of this is inspired by (and in fact uses a fair amount of) the awesome HTML5 Boilerplate.

This repository features a basic HTML-only skeleton as well as a simple SLIM PHP app with Twig templates. To install all dependencies, [get Composer](http://getcomposer.org/) and run
<pre>
	php composer.phar install
</pre>
